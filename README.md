# Who-Is-Calling
Implemented "ME" app for android platform, with firebase, Animation, notifications, services, etc.
The application works as follows: When a user installs the application, he receives a request for access to his contacts,
in order to take the contacts and save them in a database (i using in Firebase).
In the first time that user connection to my App, The user enters his name and numbers and after he confirm the permmision to take his contacts,
each contact add to database with the name of user.
Eventually a kind of network is created that each user gives information and receives information back.
There are different types of options in the app that I created:
<summary> When a number calls you, you are notified of the number and its name.</summary>
<summary> You can search for a specific cell phone number and know its name.</summary>
<summary> You can see what people are calling you on their phone.</summary>
